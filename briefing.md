 As -salam.  So  have  a  look.  In  the  deliverables  folder  you  find  these  files.
 I  show  you  in  cursor.  It's  the  invoice  generator  folder  and  the  website  folder  as  well  as  a  markdown
 file  that  includes  the  deliverables.  Read  through  this  file,  watch  the  Commodore  recording  I'm
 recording  right  now  and  then  look  at  the  projects.  The  first  one  is  the  website.  The  website  is  this
 project.  It's  a  website  for  a  new  company  we  make.  It  has  dropdowns.  These  are  all  inner  pages.
 And  then  it  has  legal  inner  pages.  There  are  no  languages  set  yet.  These  will  come  afterwards,  I  guess.
 And  then  the  other  folder,  the  invoice  generator,  is  this  invoice  generator.  And  that's  pretty  much  it.
 So,  the  deliverables.  We  need  to  refactor  both  of  them  into  our  11ty  pipeline,  basically,  that  we  can  reskin  easy.
 As  you  can  see,  everything  in  here,  okay?  It  needs  to  have  a  theme  layer.  It  needs  to  use  this  ES  build,  I  guess,  for  the  JavaScript  modules.
 Like,  if  you  see  something  that  doesn't  make  a  thousand  percent  sense,  feel  free  to  give  some  feedback  to  it,  okay?
 And  then,  instead  of  just  using  a  single  CSS  file,  we  use  SCSS.  I  know  that  the  AI  can  just  read  the  main  CSS,  no  problem.
 But  having  everything  in  components  will  make  it  so  much  easier  to  reskin.  Because  it's  not  just  straight  reskinning.
 We  will  also  have  to  slightly  rebuild  sections  for  each  client  and  stuff,  right?
 But  that  will  be  the  base  for  most  of  the  websites  we  build  moving  forward.
 And,  yeah,  I've  been  trying  yesterday  a  bit  and  then  today  again.  And  it  just  went  left  and  right  and  didn't  fully...
 Couldn't  fully  do  the  task.  Although  I  gave  it  a  bunch  of  guardrails,  right?
 So,  yeah,  you  give  it  a  go,  okay?
 Very  important  that  if  you  hold  both  versions,  the  original  one  and  the  refactured  one,  next  to  each  other,
 They  need  to  be  identical.  You  already  know  how  it  goes,  right?
 Everything  needs  to  act  exactly  the  same.  Same  padding,  same  distances,  same  everything  across  all  the  screens.
 And,  yeah,  that's  pretty  much  the  task.  Try,  okay?
 And  if  you  complete  that  one  properly,  it's  done,  okay?
 I  have  a  bunch  of  work  coming  very  soon.
